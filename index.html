        Beagles are widely considered to be good with other pets and children. They are cheerful dogs that like affection. They prefer company, however, and if left alone, may howl and be destructive. According to one consumer's guide on dogs, beagles also top the list for excessive barking and can be difficult to housebreak and obedience train.

        Beagles are active, curious dogs. They are also hound dogs, so it's in their nature to roam. Care must be taken to prevent them from wandering off into harm's way by keeping them contained in a fenced-in yard or on a leash when outside of the house.

Beagles also are friendly little dogs. <em>Don't depend on them to guard your house</em>. They may bark, but are unlikely to do much more than wag their tails if confronted with an intruder
